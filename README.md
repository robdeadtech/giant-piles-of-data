Creative people have Giant Piles of Data

## Uniterruptable Power Supply (UPS)
1. What is the power draw of your devices? This will inform the battery size you choose.
2. Does the UPS have a data port, and is your device compatible? This will allow the UPS to gracefully shut down your machine.

## 3-2-1 Rule
Have 3 copies of your data, on two local devices, and a third offsite.

## RAID
Random Array of Independant Disks. RAID 1 is simple mirroring. Other RAID flavors allow you to distribute multiple copies of data across mulitple disks, so any one disk failure shouldn't kill your data.
